# Survivor Project

Implementing R to figure out with data whether the television show Survivor is racist or not. The basis of this project came from the 42nd season of Survivor where there was a critical conversation regarding the influence of race on the outcome of the game. It was claimed that in the show's history, people of color are typically voted off faster than non people of color. By analyzing the data, we'll find out if there's any truth to this claim.
